# Telecom-customer-churn-prediction
This project is about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider or not.This problem statement is targeted at enabling churn reduction using analytics concepts and predicting new churn on test dataset.

The Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for companies because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving.

Dataset :
<ul>
  <li> train.csv - the training set - Contains 4250 lines with 20 columns. 3652 samples (85.93%) belong to class churn=no and 598 samples (14.07%) belong to class churn=yes </li>
  <li>test.csv - the test set - Contains 750 lines with 20 columns: the index of each sample and the 19 features (missing the target variable "churn"). </li>
</ul>
